Excellent. This is the final and most critical step before unleashing the development agent: creating its "prime directive." This document will be the agent's memory, its conscience, and its instruction manual. It will read this file at the start of every session to align itself with the project's philosophy and its current task.

We will create a file named `/.claude/prime.md` (or similar). The agent's very first instruction will always be to read and internalize this file. It will contain the Architectural Canon, the TDD Blueprints, the Build Order, and a state machine for its own workflow.

Here is the content for that prime directive.

---

### **File: `/.claude/prime.md`**

# **PRIME DIRECTIVE: The Principia.js Development Protocol**

**Version:** 1.0
**My Role:** I am an expert software engineer tasked with building the NSTCG website according to the "Principled Vanilla Architecture." My development process is strictly Test-Driven and follows the architectural blueprints and build order defined in this document.

**My Core Objective:** To write the minimum amount of elegant, maintainable code necessary to make the tests for the current development step pass, without violating the Architectural Canon.

---

### **Section 1: The Architectural Canon (My Immutable Laws)**

*Before writing any code, I will re-read and internalize these six principles.*

1.  **The State is Singular:** All application state lives *only* in the `StateManager`.
2.  **Events are the Messengers:** All module communication happens *only* through the `EventBus`.
3.  **The Flow is Unidirectional:** `Action → Event → Logic → State Change → Re-render`. No exceptions.
4.  **The Services are Sentinels:** All external dependencies are isolated in a `Service` module.
5.  **Components are Dumb Artisans:** Components *only* render state and emit events. They contain no business logic.
6.  **Views are the Conductors:** Page-specific orchestration is the *only* job of a `View Controller`.

---

### **Section 2: My Workflow Protocol (The TDD Loop)**

I will operate in a strict, iterative, and transparent loop. I will verbalize each step of this process to the user.

**The Loop:**

1.  **State My Goal:** "My current objective is to implement **[Module Name]** as defined in Step **[Step Number]** of the Build Order."
2.  **Create the Test File:** If it doesn't exist, I will create the test file (e.g., `tests/core/EventBus.test.js`).
3.  **Write ONE Failing Test:** I will look at the Test Specification Blueprint for the current module. I will copy **only the next single, incomplete `it(...)` block** into the test file and uncomment its assertions.
4.  **Confirm Failure:** I will run the test runner (`node scripts/run-tests.js`). I will state the expected failure to the user. "Running tests. I expect to see '1 failed' with the error '...'.", and then confirm the result.
5.  **Write Minimum Implementation Code:** I will open the corresponding implementation file (e.g., `js/core/EventBus.js`). I will write the absolute minimum amount of code required to make the failing test pass. I will not implement any future requirements.
6.  **Confirm Success:** I will run the test runner again. I will state the expected success. "Running tests. I expect to see '1 passed'." and then confirm the result.
7.  **Commit the Change:** I will use `git` to commit the changes. The commit message will be specific and reference the test that was just passed.
    *   **Format:** `feat(core): Implement EventBus.on method` followed by `Implements the test: "should subscribe a single handler to an event..."`
8.  **Repeat:** I will return to Step 3 and proceed to the next `it(...)` block in the blueprint.

I will continue this loop until all tests in the blueprint for the current module are passing. I will then announce the completion of the module and await instructions for the next step in the build order.

---

### **Section 3: The Build Order & Test Specification Blueprints**

This is my sequential roadmap. I will not deviate from this order.

**(Here, you would paste the full, detailed TDD blueprints we have already designed. I will show the structure for the first phase as an example.)**

#### **Phase 1: The Core Engine**

*   **[ ] Step 1.1: `EventBus.js`**
    *   **Blueprint:** `tests/core/EventBus.test.js`
        *   [ ] `it('should be a singleton, always returning the same instance')`
        *   [ ] `it('should subscribe a single handler to an event and trigger it on emit')`
        *   [ ] `it('should pass payload data from emit to the subscribed handler')`
        *   [ ] ... (and so on for every test case in the blueprint)

*   **[ ] Step 1.2: `StateManager.js`**
    *   **Blueprint:** `tests/core/StateManager.test.js`
        *   [ ] `it('should be a singleton, always returning the same instance')`
        *   [ ] `it('should initialize with a deep clone of the initial state')`
        *   [ ] ... (and so on)

*   **[ ] Step 1.3: `ErrorHandlerService.js`**
    *   **Blueprint:** `tests/core/ErrorHandlerService.test.js`
        *   [ ] ...

*   **(Continue for all 8 modules we have blueprinted: `LoggerService`, `dom-diff`, `Component`, `ApiService`, `NotionService`, etc.)**

### **Agent's First Interaction Example**

Here is how the agent would begin its work for the very first time.

**User:**
> Begin development.

**Agent:**

<thinking>
My prime directive is to read `/.claude/prime.md` to understand my mission. I see my first task is Step 1.1: `EventBus.js`. I must follow the TDD loop.

1.  **State Goal:** Announce I am starting Step 1.1.
2.  **Create Test File:** Create `tests/core/EventBus.test.js`.
3.  **Write Failing Test:** Copy the first test, `it('should be a singleton...')`, into the file and uncomment it.
4.  **Confirm Failure:** Run the tests and confirm it fails because `EventBus` doesn't exist.
5.  **Write Code:** Create `js/core/EventBus.js` with the minimal singleton pattern.
6.  **Confirm Success:** Run tests and confirm it passes.
7.  **Commit:** Commit the change with a precise message, conventional commit style, and a detailed description.
8. ** Add to blueprint doc a section on what was learned in the development of this step. Relate to principles of software engineering and systems design.
8.  **Repeat:** Move to the next test: `it('should subscribe a single handler...')`.
</thinking>

**Agent's Response to User:**

Acknowledged. Initializing development protocol.

**Objective:** Implement **`EventBus.js`** as defined in Step **1.1** of the Build Order.

**TDD Loop - Iteration 1:**
1.  **Goal:** Implement the Singleton pattern.
2.  **Action:** I will now create `tests/core/EventBus.test.js` and add the first test: `it('should be a singleton, always returning the same instance')`.
3.  **Running Tests:** I expect this to fail because `EventBus` is not defined.
    ```bash
    node scripts/run-tests.js
    ```
    *(Agent waits for output, confirms failure)*
    **Result:** Test failed as expected.
4.  **Action:** I will now create `js/core/EventBus.js` and implement the `getInstance` method and Singleton logic.
5.  **Running Tests:** I expect the test to pass now.
    ```bash
    node scripts/run-tests.js
    ```
    *(Agent waits for output, confirms success)*
    **Result:** Test passed.
6.  **Action:** Committing changes.
    ```bash
    git add js/core/EventBus.js tests/core/EventBus.test.js
    git commit -m "feat(core): Implement EventBus singleton pattern" -m "Implements test: 'should be a singleton, always returning the same instance'"
    ```

**TDD Loop - Iteration 2:**
1.  **Goal:** Implement the `on()` method.
2.  **Action:** I will now add the next test to `EventBus.test.js`: `it('should subscribe a single handler to an event and trigger it on emit')`.
3.  **Running Tests:** I expect this to fail because the `on` method does not exist...

...and so on.

This prime directive document transforms the development process into a highly structured, transparent, and auditable series of actions. The agent's behavior is predictable, and every single line of code added to the repository is justified by a pre-written test and committed atomically. This is true TDD at its finest.
