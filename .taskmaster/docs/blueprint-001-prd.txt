# Blueprint 001: EventBus Implementation

## Overview
Implement the EventBus module following the Principia.js architecture and Test-Driven Development.

## Phase
Phase 1 - Core Engine

## Prerequisites: None (Core Engine module)

## Architectural Canon
1. The State is Singular: All application state lives only in the StateManager
2. Events are the Messengers: All module communication happens only through the EventBus
3. The Flow is Unidirectional: Action → Event → Logic → State Change → Re-render
4. The Services are Sentinels: All external dependencies are isolated in a Service module
5. Components are Dumb Artisans: Components only render state and emit events
6. Views are the Conductors: Page-specific orchestration is the only job of a View Controller

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Implementation
1. Create the module file structure
2. Implement singleton pattern
3. Set up TypeScript interfaces and types

### Test-Driven Development Tasks
- [ ] Test: "should be a singleton, always returning the same instance" - Implement getInstance method
- [ ] Test: "should subscribe a single handler to an event and trigger it on emit" - Implement on() and emit() methods
- [ ] Test: "should pass payload data from emit to the subscribed handler" - Enhance emit() to pass data
- [ ] Test: "should allow multiple handlers for the same event" - Update event storage to handle arrays
- [ ] Test: "should return unsubscribe function when subscribing" - Return function from on()
- [ ] Test: "should remove handler when unsubscribe is called" - Implement unsubscribe logic
- [ ] Test: "should not call handler after unsubscribe" - Verify unsubscribe functionality
- [ ] Test: "should handle events with no subscribers gracefully" - Add error handling
- [ ] Test: "should call handlers in order of subscription" - Ensure FIFO execution
- [ ] Test: "should catch and log errors in handlers without affecting other handlers" - Add error isolation
- [ ] Test: "should emit special error event when handler throws" - Implement error event system
- [ ] Test: "should support once() for single-use handlers" - Implement once() method
- [ ] Test: "should allow * wildcard subscriptions for all events" - Add wildcard support
- [ ] Test: "should provide event name to wildcard handlers" - Pass event metadata
- [ ] Test: "should be able to remove all handlers for an event with off()" - Implement off() method
- [ ] Test: "should be able to check if event has listeners with hasListeners()" - Add introspection

### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Add error handling through ErrorHandlerService (once available)
- [ ] Implement logging via LoggerService (once available)
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods

### Documentation & PR
- [ ] Update module exports in index.js
- [ ] Create comprehensive PR with test results

## Testing Strategy
Follow strict TDD process:
1. Write/uncomment one test
2. Run test and see it fail
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit the change
6. Repeat for next test

## Success Criteria
- All tests in tests/core/EventBus.test.js pass
- No direct dependencies between modules
- Follows all architectural canon rules
- Clean, documented code
- Comprehensive PR created via gh tool
