# Blueprint 003: ErrorHandlerService Implementation

## Overview
Implement the ErrorHandlerService module following the Principia.js architecture and Test-Driven Development.

## Phase
Phase 1 - Core Engine

## Prerequisites: None (Core Engine module)

## Architectural Canon
1. The State is Singular: All application state lives only in the StateManager
2. Events are the Messengers: All module communication happens only through the EventBus
3. The Flow is Unidirectional: Action → Event → Logic → State Change → Re-render
4. The Services are Sentinels: All external dependencies are isolated in a Service module
5. Components are Dumb Artisans: Components only render state and emit events
6. Views are the Conductors: Page-specific orchestration is the only job of a View Controller

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Implementation
1. Create the module file structure
2. Implement singleton pattern
3. Set up error type definitions and interfaces
4. Import EventBus for error event notifications

### Test-Driven Development Tasks
- [ ] Test: "should be a singleton instance" - Implement getInstance method
- [ ] Test: "should capture and log uncaught errors" - Set up global error handlers
- [ ] Test: "should capture unhandled promise rejections" - Handle promise rejections
- [ ] Test: "should emit error:occurred event via EventBus" - Integrate with EventBus
- [ ] Test: "should include error details in event payload" - Structure error data
- [ ] Test: "should categorize errors by type" - Implement error classification
- [ ] Test: "should format error stack traces" - Clean stack trace presentation
- [ ] Test: "should extract error context (file, line, column)" - Parse error metadata
- [ ] Test: "should handle string errors gracefully" - Support throw "string"
- [ ] Test: "should handle non-Error objects" - Support arbitrary throws
- [ ] Test: "should prevent infinite error loops" - Add recursion protection
- [ ] Test: "should track error frequency" - Implement error counting
- [ ] Test: "should support error recovery strategies" - Add recovery callbacks
- [ ] Test: "should provide registerHandler() for custom handlers" - Plugin system
- [ ] Test: "should call custom handlers in order" - Handler chain execution
- [ ] Test: "should stop propagation if handler returns true" - Handler control flow
- [ ] Test: "should support error severity levels" - Add error classification
- [ ] Test: "should expose recent errors via getRecentErrors()" - Error history
- [ ] Test: "should limit error history to prevent memory leaks" - Bounded history
- [ ] Test: "should provide clearErrors() method" - History cleanup
- [ ] Test: "should support development vs production modes" - Environment awareness
- [ ] Test: "should sanitize sensitive data in production" - Security considerations

### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Integrate with EventBus for error notifications
- [ ] Add development/production mode handling
- [ ] Set up global window error listeners
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods

### Documentation & PR
- [ ] Update module exports in index.js
- [ ] Create comprehensive PR with test results

## Testing Strategy
Follow strict TDD process:
1. Write/uncomment one test
2. Run test and see it fail
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit the change
6. Repeat for next test

## Success Criteria
- All tests in tests/core/ErrorHandlerService.test.js pass
- Properly integrated with EventBus
- Follows all architectural canon rules
- Clean, documented code
- Comprehensive PR created via gh tool
