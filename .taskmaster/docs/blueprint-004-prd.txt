# Blueprint 004: LoggerService Implementation

## Overview
Implement the LoggerService module following the Principia.js architecture and Test-Driven Development.

## Phase
Phase 1 - Core Engine

## Prerequisites: None (Core Engine module)

## Architectural Canon
1. The State is Singular: All application state lives only in the StateManager
2. Events are the Messengers: All module communication happens only through the EventBus
3. The Flow is Unidirectional: Action → Event → Logic → State Change → Re-render
4. The Services are Sentinels: All external dependencies are isolated in a Service module
5. Components are Dumb Artisans: Components only render state and emit events
6. Views are the Conductors: Page-specific orchestration is the only job of a View Controller

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Implementation
1. Create the module file structure
2. Implement singleton pattern
3. Set up log level definitions and interfaces
4. Import EventBus for log event notifications

### Test-Driven Development Tasks
- [ ] Test: "should be a singleton instance" - Implement getInstance method
- [ ] Test: "should have standard log methods (debug, info, warn, error)" - Create logging API
- [ ] Test: "should respect log level filtering" - Implement level-based filtering
- [ ] Test: "should format log messages with timestamp" - Add time formatting
- [ ] Test: "should include source location in development mode" - Add caller info
- [ ] Test: "should emit log:entry event via EventBus" - Integrate with EventBus
- [ ] Test: "should support structured logging with objects" - Handle complex data
- [ ] Test: "should handle circular references in logged objects" - Prevent JSON errors
- [ ] Test: "should support multiple log transports" - Implement transport system
- [ ] Test: "should write to console transport by default" - Console integration
- [ ] Test: "should support custom transports via addTransport()" - Transport plugins
- [ ] Test: "should call all transports for each log" - Transport broadcasting
- [ ] Test: "should support log message formatting" - Template system
- [ ] Test: "should support contextual logging with withContext()" - Context binding
- [ ] Test: "should merge context into all logs" - Context application
- [ ] Test: "should support child loggers with createChild()" - Logger hierarchy
- [ ] Test: "should inherit parent context in child loggers" - Context inheritance
- [ ] Test: "should support log buffering in setBuffered(true)" - Buffered mode
- [ ] Test: "should flush buffered logs on flush()" - Buffer management
- [ ] Test: "should limit buffer size to prevent memory issues" - Buffer bounds
- [ ] Test: "should provide getRecentLogs() method" - Log history
- [ ] Test: "should support log filtering with setFilter()" - Dynamic filtering
- [ ] Test: "should measure performance with time() and timeEnd()" - Performance logging
- [ ] Test: "should group related logs with group() and groupEnd()" - Log grouping
- [ ] Test: "should support different formats (json, pretty, minimal)" - Format options

### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Integrate with EventBus for log event notifications
- [ ] Add development/production mode handling
- [ ] Set up console transport
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods

### Documentation & PR
- [ ] Update module exports in index.js
- [ ] Create comprehensive PR with test results

## Testing Strategy
Follow strict TDD process:
1. Write/uncomment one test
2. Run test and see it fail
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit the change
6. Repeat for next test

## Success Criteria
- All tests in tests/core/LoggerService.test.js pass
- Properly integrated with EventBus
- Follows all architectural canon rules
- Clean, documented code
- Comprehensive PR created via gh tool
