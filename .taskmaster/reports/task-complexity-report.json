			"taskTitle": "Create EventBus Singleton Class Structure",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively simple task implementing a basic singleton pattern. The code is already provided and follows standard patterns. The complexity is low as it only involves creating a class with a few static methods and a private constructor.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the EventBus Singleton implementation into subtasks: 1) Create the basic class structure with private constructor and static instance, 2) Implement getInstance and _resetInstance methods with proper error handling and testing."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Event Subscription Method",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing an event subscription method with an unsubscribe capability. While the code is provided, understanding the event registration pattern and ensuring proper array management adds some complexity. The returned function creates a closure that needs to be tested.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Event Subscription implementation into subtasks: 1) Create the event storage structure, 2) Implement the 'on' method with proper event handler registration, 3) Create the unsubscribe function return mechanism with appropriate closure handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Event Emission Method",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing error handling for each handler execution, which adds complexity. The emit method needs to safely iterate through handlers and manage potential exceptions without disrupting other handlers. Error propagation strategy needs consideration.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Event Emission implementation into subtasks: 1) Create the basic emit method structure with handler retrieval, 2) Implement the handler iteration logic, 3) Add robust error handling to prevent exceptions from breaking the event chain."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Event Unsubscription Method",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"reasoning": "The unsubscription method involves array manipulation and cleanup logic. While not highly complex, it requires careful handling of edge cases like non-existent events or handlers, and proper array cleanup to prevent memory leaks.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Event Unsubscription implementation into subtasks: 1) Create the basic 'off' method structure with handler validation, 2) Implement the handler removal logic using array methods, 3) Add cleanup logic to remove empty event arrays and handle edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Unsubscribe via Returned Function",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"reasoning": "This task builds on existing functionality and primarily involves testing the unsubscribe function returned by the 'on' method. The implementation is already included in Task 2, making this more of a verification task than a development one.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Unsubscribe via Returned Function verification into subtasks: 1) Create test cases to verify the unsubscribe function correctly captures event and handler references, 2) Implement additional edge case testing for the unsubscribe functionality."
