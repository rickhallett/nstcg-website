			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Recovery Mechanisms",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error recovery mechanisms into subtasks covering: 1) Recovery eligibility determination, 2) API error retry logic, 3) Storage error recovery implementation, 4) Integration with handleError method, 5) Recovery event emission, 6) Unit tests for recovery scenarios",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it involves sophisticated error recovery strategies for different error types. It requires deep understanding of various error scenarios and appropriate recovery mechanisms. The implementation needs to handle multiple edge cases and integrate with other system components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Document and Export the ErrorHandlerService",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation and export task into subtasks covering: 1) JSDoc documentation for all methods and classes, 2) Export implementation for ErrorHandlerService and related classes, 3) Creation of index.js with proper exports",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively simple task focused on documentation and module exports. The complexity is low as it primarily involves adding JSDoc comments and ensuring proper exports. The task is important for usability but doesn't involve complex implementation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create ErrorHandlerService Singleton Class",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the ErrorHandlerService singleton class into subtasks including: 1) Creating the basic class structure with singleton pattern implementation, and 2) Adding proper JSDoc documentation and implementing the constructor with validation",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward implementation of a singleton pattern. The code is already provided and follows standard practices. The complexity is low as it only involves creating a class with static methods and a private constructor."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Initialization Method",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the init() method into subtasks including: 1) Setting up dependency injection for LoggerService and EventBus, 2) Implementing the error event listener with proper error handling, and 3) Implementing the unhandledrejection event listener with proper error handling",
			"reasoning": "This task involves dependency injection and setting up global event listeners. It has moderate complexity due to the need to properly handle different types of errors and integrate with other services. The implementation requires understanding of browser events and error handling patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling Method",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the handleError() method into subtasks including: 1) Implementing error normalization to ensure proper Error objects, 2) Adding error logging with context information, 3) Implementing silent error handling logic, and 4) Creating user-friendly message determination and UI notification",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves multiple decision paths based on error types, integration with both logging and UI notification systems, and proper error normalization. The implementation needs to handle various edge cases and provide appropriate user feedback."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Custom Application Error Classes",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of custom error classes into subtasks including: 1) Creating the base ApplicationError class with proper stack trace handling, 2) Implementing the APIError class with status code handling, and 3) Implementing the ValidationError class with validation errors array",
			"reasoning": "This task involves extending the native Error class and implementing proper inheritance patterns. It has moderate complexity due to the need to maintain proper stack traces and handle different types of application-specific errors with their unique properties."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate ErrorHandlerService with Application Bootstrap",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of ErrorHandlerService with application bootstrap into subtasks including: 1) Implementing the service initialization in the application startup sequence, and 2) Adding try-catch blocks to handle errors during initialization",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating the error handler into the application bootstrap process. It has moderate complexity due to the need to ensure the error handler is initialized before other services and can catch errors during the initialization process. The implementation requires understanding of the application lifecycle."
